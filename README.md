# flutter_kitchensink

A flutter kitchensink by Yee Siang.

## Getting Started with new project

1. Create a github repo. Take note the name must comply to flutter package naming convention and do not allow '-' in it. Do not create the READEME.md startup file yet.

2. Clone the repo to local at path `~/studio/flutter_kitchensink`

3. Create flutter app with command 
```
cd ~/studio
flutter create flutter_kitchensink
```

4. Open the project in vscode

5. Open the IOS/Android simulator, I recommend using iphone 13 on Mac (I assume xcode is already setup). Once ready, you can see "iPhone 13 (ios simulator)" shows at the bottom right of vscode status bar.

6. At its terminal, run the skeleton app using `flutter run`.

7. If everything works, you can see the flutter counter demo app running in your simulator.
